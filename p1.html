<strong>Due:  2/24 by 11:59pm via Blackboard</strong></h2><p></p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	There are a number of objectives to this assignment. 
The first is to make sure you have some experience developing a 
network-based socket 
application. Second, because you are 
allowed to use any 
references you find on the Internet (including copies of existing 
code!), this assignment 
will help you see just how many network programming aids are available.
Finally, having just a bit of practical experience will put a lot of the
 protocol concepts 
we learn into perspective. 
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Details</h3>
<ul>

    <p>
Note: All your code should compile and run on itsunix. Programs that have been developed 
    on your personal computer and do not run on itsunix will not be graded and will receive 
    0 points.</p>

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple client-server 
system. You can use 
C, Python or Java. The basic functionality of the system is a remote 
calculator. You first will be sending expressions through the client to the 
server.  The server will then calculate the result of the expression and send 
it back to the client where it is displayed. The server should also 
send back to the client the string <b>"Socket Programming"</b> as many 
times as the absolute value of the result from the expression.
<p>

Your server will start in a "passive mode", in other words, it will 
listen to a specified port for instructions 
from the client. Separately, the client will be started and will connect
 to the server on a 
given host name or IP address plus a port number. The client should take
as input from the user the host name or IP address plus the port number 
and an expression to be calculated. Consider solving an expression that 
would generate relatively big result, allowing you to test transmission 
of multiple packets (see TCP and Reliable UDP below for more details). 
</p><p>

The client, when started, should request the following information:
</p><ul>
1. Enter server name or IP address:<br>
2. Enter port:<br>
3. Enter expression:<br>
</ul>
<br>

and should accept a single line for each query.
<p>

The client should make sure that the specified port is valid, in other 
words, the
client should check if the port is in the range from 0 to 65535 and if 
not should display a message of the format <b>"Invalid port number.  Terminating."</b>
</p><p>
The client, then, will try to connect to the specified server on the 
specified port and transmit the expression to the server.</p>

<p>
The interaction flow between the client and server is as follows:<br></p>

<ol>
	<li> The server starts and waits for a connection to be established by 
the client.

	</li><li> When an expression is received, the server will:
	<ul> 
		<li> Find the result of the expression and store it in a local variable.</li>
		<li> Write the result and the corresponding number of strings <b>"Socket Programming"</b> to the connection established by the client.</li>
	</ul>
	</li><li> Finally, the client will receive the result from the socket and display it to the user.<p></p>
	</li></ol>

<p>

</p><p>
Your remote calculator should support the four basic mathematical operations plus various combinations of them:<br></p>

<ol>
	<li> Addition:</li>
		<ul>
			<li> 3 + 2 </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Subtraction:
	<ul> 
		<li> 3 - 2 </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Multiplication:</li>
	<ul> 
		<li> 3 * 2 </li>
	</ul>
	<li> Division:</li>
	<ul> 
		<li> 3 / 2 </li>
	</ul>
	<li> Combination:</li>
	<ul> 
		<li> ( 3 + 7 ) / 2 </li>
	</ul><p></p>
</ol>

<p>

Note that you have to handle network errors. Make sure that you verify in 
your client code if the connection to the server was successful. If the connection failed,

your client program should display an error of the format:  "<b>Could not connect to server.   Terminating.</b>"</p>
<p>
Also make sure your client returns an error if the result was not successfully received from the server.  The client should display the following text:  "<b>Could not fetch result.  Terminating.</b>"

</p><h4><span>TCP and Reliable UDP</span></h4>
<ul>
You will implement your client and server using both TCP and
UDP. This means you will be writing four different programs. (The
clients and servers using TCP and UDP won't be interoperable so you
won't be able to use the TCP client with the UDP server and vice
versa. As food for thought and discussion in the future, why do you
think these different protocols won't interoperate?)
Using TCP should be more straightforward since it has
connections, reliability, in-order delivery, etc. However, UDP by
itself does not include any of these features so you will have to
add a simple form of reliability. You will do this by applying the 
stop-and-wait principle. Since we are working at the application
level and there is no concept of packets, we will implement our stop
and wait reliability at the level of character strings.
<p>

The client and server using Reliable UDP will operate as follows:
</p><p>

</p><ol>
	<li> Your client will 
format the expression to be calculated and send the length of the expression to 
the server (a "length" message).  Then, in a separate transmission, the client will 
send the expression string.
<p>

</p></li><li> When the 
server receives the length message it will wait up to 500 milliseconds
for that number of bytes to be sent. If it receives the correct number
of bytes, it will respond with a string containing the characters "ACK"
(a common abbreviation for an acknowledgement).
If it does not receive the correct number of bytes by the end of the
timeout period, the server will give up, display the following text 
on the server console, and exit:
"<b>Did not receive valid expression from client.  Terminating.</b>"
If you have a large result that is broken up
into segments, every segment must be ACKed in order to preserve the
stop-n-wait characteristics of the protocol.
<p>

</p></li><li> If your client 
has not received an ACK within 1 second it will resend the length 
value and then the expression again.
<p>

</p></li><li> Your client will send, up to 3 times, before giving up, 
closing 
the connection and terminating. Upon closing connection, the client 
should display the following message: "<b>Failed to send expression. 
Terminating.</b>"
<p>

</p></li><li> The server will implement reliability in a similar 
fashion.
First, it will compute the size of the result it has to send and then
will send it to the client in a "length" message.  The server will then 
send messages containing the output one by one and will wait for up to 1 
second to receive an ACK for each message sent, before sending the next 
one. Similar to the client, 
the server will retry sending a single message up to three times before 
giving up. If the server did not receive an ACK after three attempts, 
it should display the following text on the server console and
exit: "<b>Result transmission failed.  Terminating.</b>"
<p>

</p></li><li>Finally, upon successful reception of the output, the 
client should display the result.
<p>

<b>NOTE: </b>When sending large amounts of data over UDP, you might need
to transmit multiple portions. This is because the
UDP buffer fills up before the total amount of data is sent. 
Let's look at an example - say that your server needs to send a total of 
5120 bytes but the UDP buffer is only 512 bytes. In this case, even though 
your server said that it is sending 5120 bytes, the UDP on the client delivers 
the data in 512 byte chunks because of the buffer size. A program that 
sends an ACK only if the received number of bytes is the same as the expected number 
of bytes will fail to send an ACK in this case, which eventually will cause 
the connection to timeout and the server will fail to send result to the client.
To avoid such problems, your programs will have to send an ACK 
for each received portion of data, keep track of how 
much of the entire message had been received and display the result only if the total 
amount received is equal to the value sent in the length message.

This problem will probably not occur when your client sends data to your server because the entire
expression will fit into a single packet and thus it will arrive all at
once. However, you will want to test your system with large enough
results to confirm that it works correctly. </p>

<h4><span>Examples </span></h4>
<ul>
<p>
Below are some output examples, to help you format your programs display. The format of both the TCP and 
UDP programs should be the same - that is why we don't have separate examples for TCP and UDP. The only 
difference between running TCP and UDP programs is going to be the names of the programs to be run (see 
section "Language Choice and File Names" for naming conventions). Because we only have access to one development 
machine (itsunix), you will be running both the server and the client on the same physical machine. For this purpose 
you need to use the localhost address (or 127.0.0.1) when running your programs. 
</p>
<h4><span>Starting the Server</span></h4>
<ul>
You are working on itsunix. You should start the server by issuing a command in a 
terminal, whose 
syntax should be as follows (see below for correct naming of 
executables): <p></p>

<ul>
unix1&gt; server 3300<p></p>
</ul>
where "server" is the executable 
for the TCP or UDP program you wrote and "3300" is the port number you are
going to use to establish connection.
<p>
</p></ul>
<h4><span>Client Input/Output Example</span></h4>
<ul>

You are working on itsunix. 
You should start the client by issuing the following command in a
terminal (see below for correct naming of executables):<p>

</p><ul>
unix1&gt; client <p></p>
</ul>

where client is the executable for the TCP or UDP program you wrote.<p></p>

Here are some other examples of what the client might display depending
on the user input.
<p>
</p><ul>
unix1&gt; client 
<br>Enter server name or IP address: gizmo.cs.albany.
<br> Could not connect to server.  Terminating.
<br>unix1&gt; 
<br>
</ul>
<br>or
<ul>
<br>
<br>unix1&gt; client 
<br>Enter server name or IP address: 428.163.7.19
<br> Could not connect to server.  Terminating.
<br>unix1&gt; 
</ul>
<br>
<br> or
<br>
<ul>
<br> unix1&gt; client 
<br>Enter server name or IP address: 128.163.7.19
<br>Enter port: 99999
<br>Invalid port number.  Terminating.
<br>unix1&gt; 
</ul>
<br>
<br> or
<br>
<ul>
<br> unix1&gt; client 
<br>Enter server name or IP address: 127.0.0.1

<br>Enter expression: 2 + 3
<br>
<br>Failed to send expression.  Terminating.
<br> unix1&gt; 
</ul>
<br>
<br> or
<br>
<ul>
<br> unix1&gt; client 
<br>Enter server name or IP address: 128.163.7.19
<br>Enter port: 3300
<br>Enter expression: 2 + 3
<br>
<br>Could not fetch result.  Terminating.
<br> unix1&gt; 
<br>
</ul>
<br> or
<br>
<ul>
<br> unix1&gt; client 
<br>Enter server name or IP address: localhost

</ul>
<p></p>
</ul>
<h4><span>Server Output Examples</span></h4>
<ul>
<br>unix1&gt;server 3300
<br>Did not receive valid expression from client.  Terminating.
<br>unix1&gt;
<br>
<br>or
<br>

<br>(In the case of correct operation, no output is displayed on the server console.)
</ul>
</ul>


<h4><span>Language Choice and File Names</span></h4>
<ul>

You will 
choose C, Python, or Java for this assignment. Regardless of the language
 choice, 
you must turn in exactly four programs (all headers, etc. should be 
included in 
one file). 
<br><b>Your programs should be named as indicated below and should compile with NO errors and warning and run on itsunix!</b>
<p>

For C, the programs should be:

</p><ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>Client
 in C using TCP: client_c_tcp.c </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Server in C using TCP: server_c_tcp.c </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Client in C using UDP: client_c_udp.c </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Server in C using UDP: server_c_udp.c </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>To compile your C code, use the following four commands: </p>

<ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>gcc -g
 -o client_c_tcp client_c_tcp.c</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>gcc -g -o server_c_tcp server_c_tcp.c</i>"

 </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>gcc -g -o server_c_udp server_c_tcp.c</i>"
 </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>For Java, the program names should be:</p>

<ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>Client in 
Java using TCP: client_java_tcp.java </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Server in Java using TCP: 
server_java_tcp.java </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Client in Java using UDP: 
client_java_udp.java </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Server in Java using UDP: 
server_java_udp.java </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>To compile your Java code, use the following commands:</p>

<ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>javac 
client_java_tcp.java</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>javac server_java_tcp.java</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>javac client_java_udp.java</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>javac server_java_udp.java</i>" </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>For Python, the program names should be:</p>

<ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>Client in 
Python using TCP: client_python_tcp.py </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Server in Python using TCP:

<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Client in Python using UDP: 
client_python_udp.py </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>Server in Python using UDP: 
server_python_udp.py </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>To compile your Python code, use the following commands:</p>

<ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>python
 client_python_tcp.py</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>python server_python_tcp.py</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>python client_python_udp.py</i>" </span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>"<i>python server_python_udp.py</i>" </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>NOTE:
Pay attention to all of these directions carefully. Make sure that you name 
your files and format your messages as specified in the assignment. An 
automated
program will be used for grading and if there are any deviations, you 
will lose
points! </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><span>Grading Guidelines </span></h3>
<ul>
You
may use pieces of code from the Internet to help you do this assignment
(e.g. basic socket code). However, this is just like citing a passage
from a book, so if you copy code, you <b>must</b> cite it. To do this,
put a comment at the beginning of your code that explains exactly what
you have copied, who originally wrote it, and where it came from. <p></p><p>Below
is
 a breakdown of points for this assignment. In addition to
correctness, part of the points count towards how well code is written
and documented. NOTE: good code/documentation does not imply that more
is better. The goal is to be efficient, elegant and succinct! </p>

<ul type="disc"><ul type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal"><span>30 pts: 
Clients (TCP and Reliable UDP)</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>50 pts: Servers (TCP and Reliable UDP)</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><span>20 pts: Documentation/Proper References </span></li></ul></ul>

<p>An assignment in C will be awarded up to 10 extra points (because of 
the greater challenge in the C-code socket syntax). </p>
</ul>

<h3><span>Final Warning</span></h3>
<ul>
	This is
an assignment you definitely want to start on early. The design of the
assignment is such that it is nearly impossible to provide all of the
details you need. Instead of assuming things should be done a
particular way, <b>ask questions</b>! Use every opportunity to meet
with the instructor and TAs and send them emails with  questions. Answers that are relevant to
everyone in class will be posted on the Blackboard discussion forum (which
will then be emailed to everyone).
<p>
</p></ul>

<h3><span>Assignment Turnin</span></h3>
<ul>
The assignment should be submitted using the course Blackboard page. 
Because the
web site only allows one file to be submitted, you should use zip to combine your four files into a
single archive and submit this archive for grading.<p></p>

</ul>

<h3><span>Cheating Policy </span></h3>
	<ul>
	Cheating is not tolerated. Please, read the university <a href="http://www.albany.edu/studentconduct/assets/University_at_Albany_CommunityRights8-7-15.pdf"> Community Rights and Responsibilities</a> for more information on cheating. Students caught cheating will receive 0 points for the assignment and will be reported. Of particular relevance to this assignment is the need to properly cite material you have used. Failure to do so constitutes plagiarism. <p></p>
</ul>
